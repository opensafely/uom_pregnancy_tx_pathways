# This script loads all available code usage data from files.digital.nhs.uk

# (1) snomed_code_usage: yearly summary of code usage (no code description)
# (2) snomed_code_dict: code descriptions for each year (as there are sometimes small differences across years)

# https://files.digital.nhs.uk/31/097702/SNOMED_code_usage_metadata.xlsx

# * SNOMED_Concept_ID (Text string of digits up to 18 characters long)
#   SNOMED concepts which have been added to a patient record in a general practice system during the reporting period. 
# * Description (Text string)
#   The fully specified name associated with the SNOMED_Concept_ID on the final day of the reporting period (31 July). 
# * Usage (Numeric (integer) or *)
#   The number of times that the SNOMED_Concept_ID was added into any patient record within the reporting period, rounded to the nearerst 10. 
#   Usage of 1 to 4 is displayed as *.
# * Active_at_Start
#   Active status of the SNOMED_Concept_ID on the first day of the reporting period.
#   This is taken from the most recent UK clinical extension, or associated International extention, which was published up to the start of the reporting year (1 August).
#   1 = SNOMED concept was published and was active (active = 1).
#   0 = SNOMED concept was either not yet available or was inactive (active = 0).
# * Active_at_End	"Active status of the SNOMED_Concept_ID on the first day of the reporting period.
#   This is taken from the most recent UK clinical extension, or associated International extention, which was published up to the end of the reporting year (31 July).
#   1 = SNOMED concept was published and was active (active = 1).
#   0 = SNOMED concept was either not yet available or was inactive (active = 0).

# The following files show the number of times each listed SNOMED code was added to a GP patient record within the period 1 Aug to 31 July for the years available, aggregated at England level.
